# Galaxy Computer Vision With EFIGI Data

## What are we protoyping?
```
A machine learning pipeline that begins with image preprocessing using gaussian blur, thresholding, and similar techniques.
Features will be extracted using SIFT keypoints.
The ML model will make predictions using a boosted decision tree model. 
We will also prototype a CNN that makes the same predictions so that we can compare the two.
```

## How will we evaluate the results?
```
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), confusion matrices, ROC AUC, precision, recall. 
Comparing the effects preprocessing has on machine learning model effectiveness.
